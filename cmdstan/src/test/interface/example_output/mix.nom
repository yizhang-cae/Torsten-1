The following parameters had fewer than 0.001 effective samples per transition:
  mu[1], mu[2], theta
Such low values indicate that the effective sample size estimators may be biased high and actual performance may be substantially lower than quoted.

The following parameters had split R-hat less than 1.1:
  mu[1], mu[2], theta
Such high values indicate incomplete mixing and biasedestimation.  You should consider regularization your model with additional prior information or looking for a more effective parameterization.
